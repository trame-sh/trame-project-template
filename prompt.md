study project specs
if you don't have an implemantation plan assigned on trame, request one
study your assigned implementation plan and select the most important task to work on

IMPORTANT:

- author property based tests or unit tests (which ever is best)
- after making changes to the files, run the tests
- when tests pass, update the plan.md, then commit your changes
