study project specs
if you don't have an implemantation plan claimed on trame, claim one
study your claimed implementation plan and select the most important task to work on

IMPORTANT:

- author property based tests or unit tests (which ever is best)
- after making changes to the files, run the tests
- when tests pass commit your changes, then update your implemantation plan on trame
